# Security Policy

## Reporting Vulnerabilities

If you discover a security vulnerability in this repository, please **do not open a public issue**.  
Instead, contact me directly via email: `mizhigurskiy@gmail.com`.

Be responsible. Give me a chance to review and patch it before any public disclosure.

## Scope

This is a public protocol and manifesto.  
While no sensitive infrastructure or backend is exposed here, malicious edits, spoofed PRs, or injection into documentation will be treated seriously.

## Response Time

I aim to respond to all responsible disclosures **within 48 hours**.
