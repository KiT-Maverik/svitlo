# Repository tooling

Only monorepo-wide checks, CI coordination and shared textbook-host orchestration belong here. Every maintained executable lives under a named workflow directory with its tests and fixtures.

Engine entity generators belong in `shared/engine/scripts/`, UI Kit helpers in `shared/ui-kit/scripts/`, and host preparation in `apps/<app>/scripts/`. See `studio/rules/package-scripts.md` for the canonical ownership and directory policy.
